    "Answer => In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects of similar types. A class defines the attributes and behaviors that its objects will possess.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class, created from the class blueprint. Objects have their own identity and state, and can interact with each other through the methods defined in their class.\n",
    "\n",
    " Here's a example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a class named \"Animal\" which has attributes such as name, species, and age, and methods such as eat and sleep. An object of the Animal class could be a specific animal, such as a cat with a name of \"Fluffy\", species of \"Persian\", and age of 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object of the Animal class, we would use the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Class Animal:`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_animal = Animal()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `my_animal` is an object of the Animal class. We can then use the methods defined in the Animal class to interact with our object. For example, we could make our animal sleep by calling the sleep method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_animal.sleep()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would execute the code defined in the sleep method of the Animal class, which might involve the animal closing its eyes and slowing down its breathing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also change the attributes of our animal object. For example, we could change the name of the animal from \"Fluffy\" to \"Whiskers\" by setting the name attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_animal.name = \"Whiskers\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Animal class provides a template for creating animal objects with shared properties and behaviors, while each object is a distinct instance with its own attributes and state."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: It refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class. Encapsulation allows us to protect the data from outside interference and misuse, ensuring that it can only be accessed and modified through the defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: It refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary information to the user. In other words, abstraction allows us to focus on the essential features of an object and ignore the irrelevant details. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: It refers to the ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from its parent class. This enables us to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes that represent increasingly specific concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: It refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or to have multiple behaviors. Polymorphism allows us to define methods in a superclass that can be overridden in its subclasses, allowing for different implementations of the same method in different objects."
