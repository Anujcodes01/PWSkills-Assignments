Guido van Rossum was a Dutch programmer, and he designed Python with the goal of creating a simple and easy-to-read programming language that could be used for a wide range of applications. The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Since then, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used in a wide range of fields such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more."

Python's interpreted nature makes it easier to write and test code quickly, since you don't need to wait for a lengthy compilation step before running your code.
